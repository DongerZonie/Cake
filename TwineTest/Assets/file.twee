Congratulations! You helped Dolores navigate her first few months in a new city. 
You were tasked with helping Dolores stay food secure as she got settled in a new city.
Let’s see how you did.
<<if $food < 3>>
Based loosely on the HFSSM criteria, Dolores experienced mild food insecurity. 
She was able to provide a sufficient amount of food for her family, but she had to make many personal sacrifices to make this happen. 
Even then, she was not always able to provide her family with the kinds of healthy and culturally appropriate foods that she wanted her family to consume.
<<elseif $food < 5>>
Based loosely on the HFSSM criteria, Dolores experienced moderate food insecurity. 
She had to make trade-offs on both the quantity and quality of food that her family consumed. 
She made many personal sacrifices as she chose between buying groceries closer to home at a higher price, travelling longer distances for cheaper groceries, or relying on the charity of food banks and community kitchens to make it happen. 
On many occasions, she was not always able to provide her family with the kinds of healthy and culturally appropriate foods that she wanted her family to consume. 
<<elseif $food < 8>>
Based loosely on the HFSSM criteria, Dolores experienced severe food insecurity. 
She reduced the quantity and quality of the foods that her and her children ate and she often skipped meals to ensure that her children had enough to eat. 
Long term if Dolores continues make these types of personal sacrifices to feed her children, she could be putting herself at risk for malnutrition, decreased immune functioning, and severe fatigue. 
<<else>>
Based loosely on the HFSSM criteria, Dolores and her children experienced severe food insecurity. 
She greatly reduced the quantity and quality of the foods that her and her children ate and often skipped meals to ensure that her children had food. 
Dolores and her children often went hungry. 
This level of food insecurity puts the health of the whole family at risk. 
Long term if Dolore’s family continues to suffer from this level of food insecurity, she and her children will be at high risk for malnutrition, decreased immune functioning, and severe fatigue.
<<endif>>

<<if $money < 0>>
<<set $debt to $money * -1.2>>
To pay for all of her expenses, Dolores went further into debt. 
These expenses were paid for with a credit card. Credit cards carry high interest rates and penalties. 
Indeed, although the final game balance was $[$money], in reality Dolores will end up spending at least $[$debt] to pay off this credit card debt once fees and interest are taken into consideration. 
The decision to go into debt to pay for immediate expenses helped Dolores survive more comfortably in the short term, but it puts her at risk of continuing food insecurity in the long term, as it adds to her growing expenses, leaving her with even less funds to pay for food and other necessities each month. 
<<else>>
Congratulations! You ended the game with $[$money] remaining. 
You were successful in helping Dolores avoid the accumulation of additional debt. 
Living within your budget has pluses and minuses. 
You helped Dolores minimize her long term debt over time, but to make this happen, Dolores had to make many short term sacrifices to live within her strict budget -- this put Dolores’ health and food security at risk. 
Dolores is not alone in having to make these trade-offs. 
People living in poverty, even if only for a short time, must make hard trade-offs between short term survival and long term sustainability. 
<<endif>>

<<if $well < 25>>
During the game, Dolores experienced extreme stress and worry. 
Debt and food worries dominated Dolores’ time. 
As a consequence, she was not successful in maintaining connections with her First Nations community. 
Nor was she successful in building social connections that could prove to be useful in finding creative solutions for food sharing and childcare. 
Had she built these connections, the transition could have been easier on Dolores.
<<elseif $well < 60>>
During the game, Dolores experienced a great deal of stress and worry. 
These worries could have easily dominated all of Dolores’ time, but she was able to reach out and build some social connections. 
These social connections are critically important to single mothers, as they help to provide creative solutions for childcare and food sharing. 
They also ensure that Dolores can continue building ties with her First Nations community.
<<else>>
You helped Dolores successfully cope with a stressful transition and build social connections in the process. 
These social connections are critically important to Dolores as a single mother, as they can help to provide creative solutions for childcare and food sharing. 
They also ensure that Dolores can continue building ties with her First Nations community.

DOLORES IS ONE OF MANY

Although Dolores is a fictional character, her struggles with food insecurity are not unique. 
In Ontario alone, more than half a million households (> 500,000) face food insecurity. 
Indeed, although Nunavut has the highest rate of food insecurity in Canada (45.2%), Ontario has the highest number of households living with food insecurity (proof.utoronto.ca).

Members of First Nations communities are particularly at high risk for experiencing food insecurity. 
For people living in remote First Nations communities in Ontario, the cost of food is approximately 2.5 times higher than in off-reserve areas of Ontario (Veeraraghavan et al., 2016). 
But it is not just First Nations individuals living in remote fly-in communities who are at higher risk for food insecurity. 

Even in urban areas, First Nations individuals experience rates of food insecurity about three times higher than the non-Indigenous population. 
Because of past and present discriminatory policies, First Nations people are less likely than other Canadians to be able to rely on generational wealth passed down from their parents and grandparents. 
They are also more likely to experience discrimination that impacts income and access to resources. 
In addition, few urban grocery stores carry culturally appropriate traditional foods.  

DOLORES IS ONE OF MANY

Single parents are also at higher risk for food insecurity. 
This is especially true for single mothers. 
Indeed, single mother households experience food insecurity at a rate two times greater than single-father households (Dieticians of Canada, 2016). 
In general, female parents are significantly more likely than male parents to make personal sacrifices to ensure that children do not go hungry. 
Rates of food insecurity are particularly high among single Aboriginal mothers who face additional sources of discrimination.

Dr. Cyndy Baskin, of Ryerson University, has studied the creative solutions that young Aboriginal mothers use to feed their children. 
These solutions include building community connections that allowed for the sharing of childcare and meal solutions. 
They also include connections with Friendship Centres and Aboriginal food banks. 
The women in Dr. Baskin’s study reported that they found the Aboriginal foods banks to be of higher quality than non-Aboriginal food banks. 
Like Dolores, these young Aboriginal mothers showed incredible strength and resiliency in finding creative solutions to feed and take care of their children. 
Many thanks go to Dr. Baskin and the other authors of this article, as they provided inspiration for the creation of the character Dolores.
