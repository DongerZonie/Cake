Dolores is a 26-year old single mother with two sons, ages 9 (Alex) and 6 (Nick). Dolores was raised by her grandmother, Elenore. Elenore was born in a First Nations community, but was separated from her parents at a young age when she was forced to attend residential school. Elenore hated residential school and spent most of the year looking forward to the six weeks during the summer that she could visit her family. 
During her home visits, Elenore helped her parents hunt, gather, and prepare traditional foods – foods she was not allowed to have at residential school. Elenore spent more than 10 months out of the year forbidden to speak her native language, eat traditional foods, or practice the ways of her culture. Over the years, Elenore was left with a deep sense of loss and a lack of connection to her family and to her culture. Eventually she married a non-Aboriginal man and left behind her family's traditional ways of living. When she married, she lost her legal status as a First Nations woman. Before Elenore’s death, Dolores tried to help her grandmother (and herself) reclaim their legal status under Bill C-31. Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful in locating the necessary lineage documents required to have their status reinstated.
Dolores grew up intensely curious about her grandmother’s upbringing. But, Elenore never talked about her childhood, residential school, or her family’s way of life. The only time that Dolores got a glimpse of her grandmother’s identity as a First Nations woman was when Elenore made traditional foods. Each Fall, Elenore would make a huge feast with traditional foods that she remembered from her childhood. Prior to the big day, her grandmother would drive to a Community Store located on the nearest reserve and buy fresh goose, moose meat, lake trout, and a range of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and grains. She would then spend days preparing the harvest feast. Some of Dolores’ warmest memories involve her helping her grandmother make these traditional meals. 
After her grandmother died, Dolores worked to put herself through nursing school. Despite working full time, her minimum wage job was not enough to pay all of her expenses -- especially while raising two children as a single mom. To finance her degree, Dolores took out student loans through the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) and often relied on her credit card to make through each month. Fortunately, Dolores finished her nursing degree and has accepted a job offer for a nursing position. This is good because she now has $22,000 in student load debt and a maxed out credit card to pay back. The nursing position pays an annual salary of $48,000 per year, plus benefits. The job is located in a major urban environment far away from the small town where she grew up. Dolores and her children will have to move.
The new job does not start until October, but Dolores would like to move at the beginning of September so that her children can start the school year in the new city. Dolores will need to find an apartment in the new city, enroll her kids in school, figure out transportation to and from work, and manage her limited financial resources until her first pay check is received at the end of October. Dolores has taken out a $6,000 short term loan to help her through the move. As part of her monthly expenses, Dolores will need to pay back $250 in student loan debt, $250 for the personal loan repayment, and at least $100 minimum payment on her credit card.
Can you help Dolores keep her family food secure, as she struggles to adjust to a new city and avoid additional debt?

You need to buy groceries to last you two weeks. 
As a nurse, you understand the importance of healthy eating, but fresh meat and produce cost a lot more than pre-packaged frozen and boxed foods. 
You can cut costs by making meals from scratch, but as a single working mom you rarely have more than 15 to 20 minutes to make a meal for your family. 
What’s your key priority?

Once per week several woman from the center also carpool out to the Indigenous food bank. 
They tell you that although the Indigenous food bank is farther awhile, it is better than the local one as it carries for fresh fruits and vegetables.

Today they are talking about work and childcare. 
One woman, who works the night shift, shares with the group that she solved her childcare issue by getting a roommate who worked an opposite shift from her. 
In exchange for a free room to sleep in, the roommate provides childcare at night. Because the kids are asleep through most of the night, it’s a win-win situation for both people. 
It’s good to hear how other people manage these situations!

You are able to leave the food bank with a turkey, potatoes, fresh vegetables, and several non-perishable food items. 
By skipping a couple of your own meals, you are able to make these groceries stretch for the first two weeks of October. What do you want to do for groceries the rest of the month?

The Indigenous food bank is open tonight from 5pm to 9pm. 
The next time it is open is not for another five days. 
You need groceries now. 
You must work tonight from 7pm to 7am. 
It takes an hour of travel time to get between the food bank and your apartment. 
You will need another hour to travel to and get ready for your work shift. 
Even if you arrived at the foodbank right at 5pm and got your groceries quickly, you would still be cutting it extremely close in terms of making it to work on time.

You gather your children from school right at 3:30pm and rush to the Indigenous food bank. 
Traffic is not bad, so you arrive there early. 
Unfortunately, there is a sign on the door stating that due to a power outage, the Indigenous food bank had to close today. 
You wasted two hours in travel time and $20 in transportation costs and you still do not have any groceries to feed your family.

Maybe next month you will have more time. In the meantime, how do you want to feed your family?

The cheapest way to get food for your family is to go the food bank.  
The food bank closest to you typically has the fewest food options, but you can get there quickly. 
The Indigenous food bank typically has a wider range of options, but it is further away. 
Alternatively, you can see if the Friendship Center has any food-related community events coming up.

The food bank is experiencing a post-Thanksgiving lull. 
There are few grocery options available this week. 
You are able to pick up a few items, but it is clear that you will need to get your groceries some other way to feed your family the rest of this month

The Indigenous food bank is open tomorrow night from 5pm to 9pm. 
You have tomorrow night off! It takes you and the children two hours in travel time and $20 in travel costs to get to the food bank and back.
Fortunately, when you arrive they have plenty of food options available. The food bank just received a huge donation of groceries remaining after the Thanksgiving rush. You leave the food bank with a ham, potatoes, fresh vegetables, and several non-perishable food items – more than enough food to get you through the end of October!

You find another nurse who is willing to switch you shifts. 
The only problem is that the new shift raises another issue: You would be switching with someone who works the Saturday day shift. 
Your roommate is not available to watch the kids on that day. 
It will cost you $50 to hire a babysitter to watch the kids while you work the other shift.

Your first meeting goes well. Your youngest son Nick is doing well in Grade 1. His teacher has no concerns. 
Your second meeting goes less well.

This does not sound like your son who has always love school and been kind to others.

You hate to miss the meeting, but it is just too difficult to switch shifts. 
One week later you receive a note from the teacher that your son was sent to the principal’s office for getting into a fight. 
When you call the teacher to learn more about the fight, she points out that the problem have been going on for weeks. She had wanted to talk to you about during the parent interviews, but you did not attend. 
You feel angry that you were not told that the parent interview was high priority.

You ask Alex what happened. 
He tells you that two boys at his school have been picking on him and stealing his lunch for weeks. (This explains why your son has been so hungry after school!) 
The last time they tried to steal his lunch, he yelled at them to stop. 
The teacher heard him yell and sent him to the principal’s office for starting a fight. 
He tried to explain the situation, but neither his teacher nor the principal believed him. 
This does not seem fair.

You want to meet in the early afternoon when you are off work, or at least on one of your days off, but the only time that is available is in the evening on a day that you are scheduled to work. 
You can switch shifts to make it work, but then you will have to hire a sitter to watch the kids on the day that you work the other shift.

You cannot afford to hire a babysitter so that you can switch shifts. 
You are forced to cancel the face-to-face meeting and make do with a phone meeting. 
In your phone conversation, you try to make it clear that you are very unhappy with how your son has been treated by these other children and by the school. 
Still, it is unclear how well your message was received by the teacher and the principal. 
The stealing stops, but your son continues to hate school.

To celebrate your first official paycheck you decide to make a traditional meal.To make all of the dishes that you want to make you will need ingredients such as hickory nuts, country meats (such as venison/deer, moose, or caribou), and trout.
The problem is that you do not know where to get these ingredients.
As a child, your grandmother used to buy these traditional foods from a nearby community store. The nearest community store to you is four hours away!
It would take you all day and cost you at least $60 in travel costs to go the store.
You find a few specialty stores online that allow you to order venison, hickory nuts, and trout for delivery, but each item comes from a separate store. You would have to pay shipping and delivery costs for each item. What do you want to do?
