After their first day of school, the children report mixed reviews about their experiences. 
Your two older daughters felt different from their classmates, especially when it came to their lunches. 
Tomorrow, they would like you to pack them a more “Canadian” lunch, with a turkey and cheese sandwich, goldfish crackers, carrot sticks, and a cookie. 
You do not currently have these types of groceries in your home. 
What would you like to do?

Your wife goes into labour and you welcome a fourth child into your family! 
When your first three children were born, you hosted an aqeeqah (birth ceremony) to welcome your baby. 
Each time, your family members would bring traditional dishes and you would supply a roasted lamb to feed your family, friends, and neighbors. 
You think that holding a traditional aqeeqah is important for marking the occasion of your fourth child’s birth.
