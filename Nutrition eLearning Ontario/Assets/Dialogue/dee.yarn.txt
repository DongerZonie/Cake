Dolores is a 26-year old single mother with two sons, ages 9 (Alex) and 6 (Nick). 
Dolores was raised by her grandmother, Elenore. 
Elenore was born in a First Nations community, but was separated from her parents at a young age when she was forced to attend residential school. 
Elenore hated residential school and spent most of the year looking forward to the six weeks during the summer that she could visit her family. 
During her home visits, Elenore helped her parents hunt, gather, and prepare traditional foods – foods she was not allowed to have at residential school. 
Elenore spent more than 10 months out of the year forbidden to speak her native language, eat traditional foods, or practice the ways of her culture. 
Over the years, Elenore was left with a deep sense of loss and a lack of connection to her family and to her culture. 
Eventually she married a non-Aboriginal man and left behind her family's traditional ways of living. When she married, she lost her legal status as a First Nations woman. 
Before Elenore’s death, Dolores tried to help her grandmother (and herself) reclaim their legal status under Bill C-31. 
Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful in locating the necessary lineage documents required to have their status reinstated.
Dolores grew up intensely curious about her grandmother’s upbringing. But, Elenore never talked about her childhood, residential school, or her family’s way of life. 
The only time that Dolores got a glimpse of her grandmother’s identity as a First Nations woman was when Elenore made traditional foods. 
Each Fall, Elenore would make a huge feast with traditional foods that she remembered from her childhood. 
Prior to the big day, her grandmother would drive to a Community Store located on the nearest reserve and buy fresh goose, moose meat, lake trout, and a range of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and grains. 
She would then spend days preparing the harvest feast. Some of Dolores’ warmest memories involve her helping her grandmother make these traditional meals. 
After her grandmother died, Dolores worked to put herself through nursing school. 
Despite working full time, her minimum wage job was not enough to pay all of her expenses -- especially while raising two children as a single mom. 
To finance her degree, Dolores took out student loans through the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) and often relied on her credit card to make through each month. 
Fortunately, Dolores finished her nursing degree and has accepted a job offer for a nursing position. 
This is good because she now has $22,000 in student load debt and a maxed out credit card to pay back. The nursing position pays an annual salary of $48,000 per year, plus benefits. 
The job is located in a major urban environment far away from the small town where she grew up. Dolores and her children will have to move.
The new job does not start until October, but Dolores would like to move at the beginning of September so that her children can start the school year in the new city. 
Dolores will need to find an apartment in the new city, enroll her kids in school, figure out transportation to and from work, and manage her limited financial resources until her first pay check is received at the end of October. 
Dolores has taken out a $6,000 short term loan to help her through the move. 
As part of her monthly expenses, Dolores will need to pay back $250 in student loan debt, $250 for the personal loan repayment, and at least $100 minimum payment on her credit card.
Can you help Dolores keep her family food secure, as she struggles to adjust to a new city and avoid additional debt?

Because you arrived in the city late, you are only able to see a few apartments before you have to be on the return bus.

Using the internet, you identify a few housing opportunities. 
One seems perfect for you. 
It is a 3-bedroom apartment that appears to be in a good neighborhood, the rent is affordable ($1200), there is a public school nearby, and it is near a public transit line that connects directly with the hospital where you will be working.

You arrive at the station and wait two hours to meet with an officer. 
You tell your story. He starts asking you completely irrelevant questions, such as whether you were drinking on the day that the scam happened. 
You are bewildered – Why would he ask if you were drinking? 
Is he trying to suggest that you are the one to blame for getting scammed? 
You regret trying to report the crime. 
Clearly, this officer is not going to take your claim seriously. 
Now you are out the cost of the deposit money and you’ve wasted half a day at the police station.

Many cities have Indigenous Friendship Centers. 
These non-for-profit organizations support indigenous people in many ways. 
Still, you are not certain if you should contact them. 
You are curious about your First Nations’ identity, and you wish you knew more about traditional ways, but 
you have never been connected to the community, 
you do not have legal “status” as a member of a First Nations community, 
and you feel embarrassed to ask for help.
