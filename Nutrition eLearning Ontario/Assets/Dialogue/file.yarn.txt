You find another nurse who is willing to switch you shifts. 
The only problem is that the new shift would be on a Saturday. You do not have anybody to watch the kids on that day. 
It will cost you $50 to hire a babysitter to watch the kids while you work the Saturday shift.

You pay $50 to hire a babysitter. <<set $money to $money - 50>> You now have $[$money] remaining.
Your first meeting goes well. Your youngest son Nick is doing well in Grade 1. His teacher has no concerns. 
Your second meeting goes less well. Alex’s Grade 4 teacher has concerns about the fact that Alex started a fight with another child.

You hate to miss the meeting, but it is just too difficult to switch shifts. 
One week later you receive a note from the teacher that your son was sent to the principal’s office for getting into a fight. 
When you call the teacher to learn more about the fight, she points out that the problem have been ongoing on for weeks. 
She had wanted to talk to you about during the parent interviews, but you did not attend. 
You feel angry that you were not told that the parent interview was high priority. <<set $well to $well - 5>> Your level of wellbeing is now [$well].

You ask Alex what happened. He tells you that two boys at his school have been picking on him and stealing his lunch. 
The last time they tried to steal his lunch, he yelled at them to stop. The teacher heard him yelling and sent him to the principal’s office for fighting. 
He tried to explain the situation, but neither his teacher nor the principal believed him. 
This does not seem fair. What do you want to do?

You call the school to set up a meeting. The only meeting time that is available is in the evening on a day that you are scheduled to work. 
You can switch shifts to make it work, but then you will have to hire a sitter to watch the kids.

You cannot afford to hire a babysitter so that you can switch shifts. You are forced to cancel the meeting and call in instead. 
Over the phone you try to make it clear that you are very unhappy with how your son has been treated. 
Still, it is unclear how well your message was received by the teacher and the principal. 
The stealing stops, but your son continues to hate school. <<set $well to $well - 10>> Your level of wellbeing is now [$well].

You get your first paycheck! 
<<set $money to $money + 3500>> You now have $[$money].
You can finally buy some healthy groceries for the month. 
<<set $money to $money - 500>> You now have $[$money] remaining.
It’s also time to pay the next batch of monthly bills. <<set $money to $money - 2000>> You now have $[$money] remaining.
It’s been a rough past few months! You could use some comfort foods. You would like to celebrate your new job by making a traditional First Nations meal.
To make this meal, you will need hard to find ingredients such as hickory nuts, fiddleheads, and country meats (such as venison/deer, moose, or caribou). 
The problem is that you have no idea where to get these ingredients in the city. 
You look online. There is a First Nations community store four hours away. It would cost you $60 to travel there. 
A few specialty stores sell the ingredients online. But you may need to buy these items in bulk. Shipping and delivery costs could be expensive.

Congratulations! You helped Dolores navigate her first few months in a new city. 
You were tasked with helping Dolores stay food secure as she got settled in a new city.
Let’s see how you did.
<<if $food < 3>>
Based loosely on the HFSSM criteria, Dolores experienced mild food insecurity. 
She was able to provide a sufficient amount of food for her family, but she had to make many personal sacrifices to make this happen. 
Even then, she was not always able to provide her family with the kinds of healthy and culturally appropriate foods that she wanted her family to consume.
<<elseif $food < 5>>
Based loosely on the HFSSM criteria, Dolores experienced moderate food insecurity. 
She had to make trade-offs on both the quantity and quality of food that her family consumed. 
She made many personal sacrifices as she chose between buying groceries closer to home at a higher price, travelling longer distances for cheaper groceries, or relying on the charity of food banks and community kitchens to make it happen. 
On many occasions, she was not always able to provide her family with the kinds of healthy and culturally appropriate foods that she wanted her family to consume. 
<<elseif $food < 8>>
Based loosely on the HFSSM criteria, Dolores experienced severe food insecurity. 
She reduced the quantity and quality of the foods that her and her children ate and she often skipped meals to ensure that her children had enough to eat. 
Long term if Dolores continues make these types of personal sacrifices to feed her children, she could be putting herself at risk for malnutrition, decreased immune functioning, and severe fatigue. 
<<else>>
Based loosely on the HFSSM criteria, Dolores and her children experienced severe food insecurity. 
She greatly reduced the quantity and quality of the foods that her and her children ate and often skipped meals to ensure that her children had food. 
Dolores and her children often went hungry. 
This level of food insecurity puts the health of the whole family at risk. 
Long term if Dolore’s family continues to suffer from this level of food insecurity, she and her children will be at high risk for malnutrition, decreased immune functioning, and severe fatigue.
<<endif>>

<<if $money < 0>>
<<set $debt to $money * -1.2>>
To pay for all of her expenses, Dolores went further into debt. 
These expenses were paid for with a credit card. Credit cards carry high interest rates and penalties. 
Indeed, although the final game balance was $[$money], in reality Dolores will end up spending at least $[$debt] to pay off this credit card debt once fees and interest are taken into consideration. 
The decision to go into debt to pay for immediate expenses helped Dolores survive more comfortably in the short term, but it puts her at risk of continuing food insecurity in the long term, as it adds to her growing expenses, leaving her with even less funds to pay for food and other necessities each month. 
<<else>>
Congratulations! You ended the game with $[$money] remaining. 
You were successful in helping Dolores avoid the accumulation of additional debt. 
Living within your budget has pluses and minuses. 
You helped Dolores minimize her long term debt over time, but to make this happen, Dolores had to make many short term sacrifices to live within her strict budget -- this put Dolores’ health and food security at risk. 
Dolores is not alone in having to make these trade-offs. 
People living in poverty, even if only for a short time, must make hard trade-offs between short term survival and long term sustainability. 
<<endif>>

<<if $well < 25>>
During the game, Dolores experienced extreme stress and worry. 
Debt and food worries dominated Dolores’ time. 
As a consequence, she was not successful in maintaining connections with her First Nations community. 
Nor was she successful in building social connections that could prove to be useful in finding creative solutions for food sharing and childcare. 
Had she built these connections, the transition could have been easier on Dolores.
<<elseif $well < 60>>
During the game, Dolores experienced a great deal of stress and worry. 
These worries could have easily dominated all of Dolores’ time, but she was able to reach out and build some social connections. 
These social connections are critically important to single mothers, as they help to provide creative solutions for childcare and food sharing. 
They also ensure that Dolores can continue building ties with her First Nations community.
<<else>>

DOLORES IS ONE OF MANY

Although Dolores is a fictional character, her struggles with food insecurity are not unique. 
In Ontario alone, more than half a million households (> 500,000) face food insecurity. 
Indeed, although Nunavut has the highest rate of food insecurity in Canada (45.2%), Ontario has the highest number of households living with food insecurity (proof.utoronto.ca).

Members of First Nations communities are particularly at high risk for experiencing food insecurity. 
For people living in remote First Nations communities in Ontario, the cost of food is approximately 2.5 times higher than in off-reserve areas of Ontario (Veeraraghavan et al., 2016). 
But it is not just First Nations individuals living in remote fly-in communities who are at higher risk for food insecurity. 

Even in urban areas, First Nations individuals experience rates of food insecurity about three times higher than the non-Indigenous population. 
Because of past and present discriminatory policies, First Nations people are less likely than other Canadians to be able to rely on generational wealth passed down from their parents and grandparents. 
They are also more likely to experience discrimination that impacts income and access to resources. 
In addition, few urban grocery stores carry culturally appropriate traditional foods.  

DOLORES IS ONE OF MANY

Single parents are also at higher risk for food insecurity. 
This is especially true for single mothers. 
Indeed, single mother households experience food insecurity at a rate two times greater than single-father households (Dieticians of Canada, 2016). 
In general, female parents are significantly more likely than male parents to make personal sacrifices to ensure that children do not go hungry. 
Rates of food insecurity are particularly high among single Aboriginal mothers who face additional sources of discrimination.

Dr. Cyndy Baskin, of Ryerson University, has studied the creative solutions that young Aboriginal mothers use to feed their children. 
These solutions include building community connections that allowed for the sharing of childcare and meal solutions. 
They also include connections with Friendship Centres and Aboriginal food banks. 
The women in Dr. Baskin’s study reported that they found the Aboriginal foods banks to be of higher quality than non-Aboriginal food banks. 
Like Dolores, these young Aboriginal mothers showed incredible strength and resiliency in finding creative solutions to feed and take care of their children. 
Many thanks go to Dr. Baskin and the other authors of this article, as they provided inspiration for the creation of the character Dolores.
