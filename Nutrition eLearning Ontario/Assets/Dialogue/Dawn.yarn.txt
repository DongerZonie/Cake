You start working as an assistant cook at an elder care residential home. 
As part of the position, you work with a dietician who shows you tricks for preparing healthy meals that meet the residents’ nutritional needs. 
Because many of the residents are also managing diabetes, you learn a lot about your own nutritional needs in the process.
You also get one healthy meal per day as part of the position. This helps reduce your overall expenses (+$600). <<set $money to $money + 600 >> You now have $[$money].
The work is fun. If you are not able to return to truck driving, this could be an alternative career option for you. <<set $well to $well + 20 >> Your level of wellbeing is now [$well].
